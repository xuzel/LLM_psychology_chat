# 2 Background
## 2.1 Overall Condition
From the statistics released by the national epidemiological survey conducted in 1982, we can find the incidence of depression was only 0.83% then. But compared to the findings of some counterpart surveys in recent years, which generally declare that the incidence has increased up to 4%-8%, the growth trend of number of patients and the following medical needs can be easily noticed.  

However, it is widely acknowledged that both the diagnosis and the corresponding treatment of mental illness take much longer than those of physical diseases. Besides,  Chinese mainland residents may have a stronger requirement in privacy due to cultural features. Thus an application is a better choice for early diagnosis stage. There are also factors about medical resources, economic level and business needs. We would talk about more detailed contents in part 3 Motivation.
## 2.2 Domain
The term ‘psychology’ we would like to use in this report includes contents about psychological distress, mental illness and mental health. Reason of this ambiguity is that, LLM has considerable potential in practical use rather than only theories, while real conditions being complex. And as a software being designed, we pay the most attention to its performance and benefits in real world.
## 2.3 LLM in Psychology and Technical Feasibility
The progress made in natural language processing and deep learning (e.g. GPT4.0 form open AI) during the past few years provides higher feasibility for deep learning based applications in the field of psychology. Following are some examples that we’ve simply investigated.  

**SMILE**: Employing a functionality of multi-turn conversations, SMILE is a inclusive language expansion via ChatGPT[1] but can only relieve users’ psychological stress.  

**SoulChat**: SoulChat has released both single-turn corpus and multi-turn corpus. Its main concerns contain empathy, talk guidance and advice providing[2]. However, it also has cons of being not able to diagnose and obtaining insufficient information from users.  

As for our project, we plan to call a ChatGPT API while hiring prompt tuning and conventional tuning in our software development.
